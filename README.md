# Quasimorph Stop on Monster Detected

![Movement path with X's for cancel](media/thumbnail.png)

This mod allows the user to hold down the control key and continue walking if there are only detected units.  This does not affect seen units.

This is helpful when the player needs to walk down a long hallway and there are detected units that will not be in a position to attack the player.
