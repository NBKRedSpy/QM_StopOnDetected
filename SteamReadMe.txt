[h1]Quasimorph Stop on Monster Detected[/h1]


Stops the movement queue when a creature is detected in stealth mode.
The red star is the detected indicator.

Hold the Ctrl key to not stop.

Prevents the player from being "ambushed" by enemies that were detected because the player didn't abort the movement in time.
